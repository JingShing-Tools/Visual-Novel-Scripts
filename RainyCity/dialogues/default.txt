Do you like rain?

@like_rain
Really. I see.
I don't really like it, but I have no choice
to stay here.
@jump rain_after

@unlike_rain
I don't like it either.
I don't know why you are here.

@rain_after
This is my destiny. Stuck in the rainy city.
Rain drops like needles. And we can't escape 
from it.
This is a curse from a goddess.
The ancestors angered her.
So the city where they landed became the place 
the goddess of the sea poured out her anger.
The humid, hot and rainy climate here is not 
suitable for human life.
Who thought that this place was successively 
occupied by three cultures.
But it is also the climate that can protect
this land from invader.
Years of heavy rain and proximity to the sea.
The desolate continent was revived by
people's prayers.
Because the goddess of the sea created life.
She loving souls of creature.

Every once in a while strangers disappears.
Some nasty outsider.
They come from out of town. 
Go fishing for living.
No one in the area would care if they alive
or died.
But I was very concerned, so I stalk quietly. 
their fishing vessel.
It's not a fancy place, it's just a group of 
people who make a living out of it.
A group of middle-aged old man smoking and 
wearing a lantern.
@bgm=hollow_pillow
I saw that, quite accustomed to pushing down 
a group of outsiders.
The scaly goddess of the sea.
With the palms of long sharp teeth,
one by one, each one was squeezed into flesh.
the mouth is split from the hand.
That's all I can describe.
Four or five exposed eyeballs and 
two pairs of broad auricles.
The local fishermen, accustomed to it, 
folded their hands in worship.
I took a stranger's tooth from the deck.
That might be the last relic he left 
in the world.
I don't know what to do, I can only 
be glad that I am not outsiders.
Later, when I went back to harbor,
I didn't tell anyone else.

You'll keep it a secret for me, right?

@keeper
@textbox.color=0,0,0
none:People haven't seen him since 
that day.
Whether he continued to investigate 
the truth or became a oblation, no one knows.
I will continue to keep this secret 
until I died.

none:I told the local police what he did.
They said they would take over the case.
Of course, if it wasn't for me later stalk
on the vessel. Seeing him been pushed to the 
bottom of the sea.
I almost believed them. I took his teeth. 
Carry it with me all the time.
Be wary.
Don't go near RainyCity.
